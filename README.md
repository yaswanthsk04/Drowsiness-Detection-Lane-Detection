# Drowsiness-Detection-Lane-Detection
# Readme

This project was to Detect Drowsiness in Drivers and alerting them in advance. I took advantage of pre-trained face detection algorithm to extract the required features from face and would calculate the no of frames 
the drivers eyes is tend to be closed.

To run this project you will have to download the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file from the following repository: https://github.com/MortezaNedaei/Facial-Landmarks-Detection

This project was motivated and inspired by few of my colleagues from my University.
